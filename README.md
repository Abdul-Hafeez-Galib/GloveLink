# GloveLink
 GloveLink aims to tackle the challenges bedridden individuals face in communicating their basic needs, which not only affects their well-being but also places a significant burden on caregivers. We have designed a specialized glove equipped with flex sensors and a gyroscope capable of detecting hand gestures corresponding to essential requests. The sensor data is processed and sent to caregivers via WhatsApp, ensuring timely responses, and an OLED display on the glove provides visual feedback, effectively bridging the communication gap.
